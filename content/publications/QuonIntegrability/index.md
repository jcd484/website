abstract: We study confining strings in massive adjoint two-dimensional chromodynamics. Off-shell, as a consequence of zigzag formation, the resulting worldsheet theory provides a non-trivial dynamical realization of infinite quon statistics. Taking the high energy limit we identify a remarkably simple and novel integrable relativistic $N$-body system. Its symmetry algebra contains an additional "shadow" Poincar&#233; subalgebra. This model describes the $N$-particle subsector of a $T\\bar{T}$-deformed massless fermion.

#### Abstract:   
We study confining strings in massive adjoint two-dimensional chromodynamics. Off-shell, as a consequence of zigzag formation, the resulting worldsheet theory provides a non-trivial dynamical realization of infinite quon statistics. Taking the high energy limit we identify a remarkably simple and novel integrable relativistic $N$-body system. Its symmetry algebra contains an additional "shadow" Poincar&#233; subalgebra. This model describes the $N$-particle subsector of a $T\\bar{T}$-deformed massless fermion.
